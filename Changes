 [Bugfix]
 - rt#67341 : Moose bailing due to role collision should be solved in this release. It would appear I was implicitly
   importing the same role twice for some reason. Thanks Andreas J. König ( ANDK ) for reporting.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.01000103, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: +1 -1 (recommends: +1 -1, suggests: +1 -1)
 - runtime: ↑1 -1

 [Internal Notes]
 - previously used "with qw( ::GLD ::Dashes )" in main package, as if memory  serves correctly, at some past point this
   was required for correct behaviour. However, this is no longer true, and ::Dashes now imports ::GLD, so if they're
   both  specified by us, it will be like importing ::GLD twice, which will obviously trigger a symbol collision.

 [Packaging]
 - moved to @Author::KENTNL

 - ship perltidyrc

 [Tests]
 - Adds CPAN::Changes tests
