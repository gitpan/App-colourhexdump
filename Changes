 [Bugfix]
 - rt#67341 : Moose bailing due to role collision should be solved in this
   release. It would appear I was implicitly importing the same role twice
   for some reason. Thanks Andreas J. König ( ANDK ) for reporting.

 [Dependencies::Added / develop recommends]
 - Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL::Lite 0.01009803

 [Dependencies::Added / develop requires]
 - Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL::Lite

 [Dependencies::Added / develop suggests]

 [Dependencies::Changed / runtime requires]

 [Dependencies::Removed / develop requires]
 - Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::KENTNL::Lite

 [Dependencies::Removed / develop suggests]
 - Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::KENTNL 0.01017119

 [Dependencies::Removed / runtime requires]
 - MooseX::Getopt::GLD

 [Internal Notes]
 - previously used "with qw( ::GLD ::Dashes )" in main package, as if
   memory  serves correctly, at some past point this was required for
   correct behaviour.  However, this is no longer true, and ::Dashes now
   imports ::GLD, so if they're both  specified by us, it will be like
   importing ::GLD twice, which will obviously trigger a symbol collision.
