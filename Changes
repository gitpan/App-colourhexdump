 [Bugfix]
 - rt#67341 : Moose bailing due to role collision should be solved in this
   release. It would appear I was implicitly importing the same role twice
   for some reason. Thanks Andreas J. KÃ¶nig ( ANDK ) for reporting.

 [Dependencies]
 - MooseX::Getopt 0.37 is now a minimal requirement.
 - Dependency is now only on ::Dashes, not GLD.

 [Dependencies:Devel]
 - Advertises @Author::KENTNL

 [Internal Notes]
 - previously used "with qw( ::GLD ::Dashes )" in main package, as if
   memory  serves correctly, at some past point this was required for
   correct behaviour.  However, this is no longer true, and ::Dashes now
   imports ::GLD, so if they're both  specified by us, it will be like
   importing ::GLD twice, which will obviously trigger a symbol collision.

 [Packaging]
 - moved to @Author::KENTNL
 - Normalise Changelog for CPAN::Changes.
 - ship perltidyrc
